callbacks are most often used with asynchronous functions.

With asynchronous programming,
    JS programs can start long-running tasks, and continue running other tasks in parallel.

But, asynchronous programmes are difficult to write and difficult to debug.
Because of this,
    most modern asynchronous JavaScript methods don't use callbacks.
    Instead, in JS, asynchronous programming is solved using Promises instead.
