ECMAScript 2015, also known as ES6, introduced the JavaScript Promise object.

Promise.then() takes two arguments, a callback for success and another for failure.
Both are optional, so we can add a callback for success or failure only.

Ex:-
    myPromise.then(
      function(value) { /* code if successful */ },
      function(error) { /* code if some error */ }
    );
