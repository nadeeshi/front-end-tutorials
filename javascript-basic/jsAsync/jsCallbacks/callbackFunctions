A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function
This technique allows a function to call another function
A callback function can run after another function has finished


Function Sequence
    JS functions are executed in the sequence they are called.
    Not in the sequence they are defined.


When we pass a function as an argument, we don't need to use parenthesis.
    ex: - calculator(5, 5, display);


Callback Function
    Where callbacks really shine are in asynchronous functions,
    where one function has to wait for another function (like waiting for a file to load).
