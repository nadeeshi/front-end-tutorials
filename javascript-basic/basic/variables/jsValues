The JavaScript syntax defines two types of values:
    1. Fixed values - Fixed values are called Literals.
    2. Variable values - Variable values are called Variables.


JavaScript Literals
    Numbers can written with or without decimals
    Strings are text, can written within double or single quotes

JavaScript Variables
    variables are used to store data values
    JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const to declare variables.
    1. var - The var keyword also tells the browser to create variables
             The var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.

    2. let - The let keyword tells the browser to create variables
             The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
             If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.
             If you want a general rule: always declare variables with const
                    If you think the value of the variable can change, use let
             Value can be change.
             let cannot be Redeclared & must be Declared before use.
             let have Block Scope.

    3. const - constant values and cannot be changed, cannot be Redeclared


    After the declaration, the variable has no value (technically it is undefined
        ex:- var carName;


Block Scope
   Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.
   ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
   These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
   Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block:
   ex:-
       {
         let x = 5;
       }
       // x can NOT be used here

   The let keyword is not fully supported in Internet Explorer 11 or earlier.
   With let, re-declaring a variable in the same block is NOT allowed

   Variables defined with const have Block Scope.



JavaScript Comments
    // - single line comments
    /*  */ - multi-line comments


JS Identifiers/ names
    Identifiers(names) used to name Variables, Methods and Keywords
    A JavaScript name must begin with:
        A letter (A-Z or a-z)
        A dollar sign ($)
        Or an underscore (_)

    Note - Numbers are not allowed as the first character in names.

    Js identifiers are case sensitive.
    JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
