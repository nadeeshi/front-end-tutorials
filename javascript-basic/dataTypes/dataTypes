JS has Dynamic types. This means that the same variable can be used to hold different data types:
    let x;       // Now x is undefined
    x = 5;       // Now x is a Number
    x = "John";  // Now x is a String

Numbers can be written with, or without decimals
Javascript are always one type: double (64-bit floating point).
