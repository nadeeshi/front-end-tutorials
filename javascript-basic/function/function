JS function will execute when "something" invokes (calls) the function:
    When an event occurs (when a user clicks a button)
    When it is invoked (called) from JavaScript code
    Automatically (self invoked)

  Ex:-
    function name(parameter1, parameter2, parameter3) {
      // code to be executed
    }


We can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.
We can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.



Local Variables
    Variables declared within a JS function, become LOCAL to the function.
    These Local variables can only be accessed from within the function
