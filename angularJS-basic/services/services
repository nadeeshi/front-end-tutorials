AngularJS we can make our own service, or use one of the many built-in services.
A service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, our AngularJS application.
AngularJS has about 30 built-in services.

1. $location - return information about the location of the current web page
               AngularJS prefers that you use the $location service instead of the window.location object

2. $http - AngularJS AJAX, service is one of the most common used services in AngularJS applications
           The service makes a request to the server, and lets our application handle the response.
           $http is an AngularJS service for reading data from remote servers.

3. $timeout - service is AngularJS' version of the window.setTimeout function
4. $interval - service is AngularJS' version of the window.setInterval function
