AngularJS expressions are written inside double braces:
    {{ expression }}

AngularJS expressions can also be written inside a directive:
ng-bind="expression"

AngularJS expressions are much like JavaScript expressions:
They can contain literals, operators, and variables.

We can write expressions wherever we like,
AngularJS will simply resolve the expression and return the result.

Unlike JS expressions, AngularJS expressions can be written inside HTML.
AngularJS expressions do not support
    conditionals,
    loops, and
    exceptions, while JavaScript expressions do.

AngularJS expressions support
    filters, while JavaScript expressions do not.
