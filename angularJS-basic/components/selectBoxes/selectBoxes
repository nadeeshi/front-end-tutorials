AngularJS we can create dropdown lists based on items in an array, or an object.

For that, we can use ng-options directive.

ng-options vs ng-repeat
    We can also use the ng-repeat directive to make the same dropdown list:

    ng-repeat directive repeats a block of HTML code for each item in an array,
    it can be used to create options in a dropdown list,
    but the ng-options directive was made especially for filling a dropdown list with options
