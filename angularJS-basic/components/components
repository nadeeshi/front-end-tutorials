We cannot have multiple ng-App directives on a single page.
    Only one AngularJS application can be auto-bootstrapped per HTML document.
    The first ngApp found in the document will be used to define the root element to auto-bootstrap as an application.
    To run multiple applications in an HTML document you must manually bootstrap them using angular.bootstrap instead.
    AngularJS applications cannot be nested within each other.
