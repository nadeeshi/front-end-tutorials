The module is a container for the application controllers.
Controllers always belong to a module.


AngularJs has set of in-built directives which we can use to add those functionalities to our application.
And also we can use our own directives.


var app = angular.module("myApp", []);
    The [] parameter in the module definition can be used to define dependent modules.
    Without the [] parameter, we are not creating a new module, but retrieving an existing one.
