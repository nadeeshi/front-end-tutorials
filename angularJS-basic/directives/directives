AngularJS Directives
AngularJS directives are HTML attributes with an ng prefix.

AngularJS has a set of built-in directives which offers functionality to our applications.
And also we can defined our own directives as well.

We can invoke a directive by using:
    Element name -> <user-directive></user-directive>
    Attribute    -> <div user-directive></div>
    Class        -> <div class="user-directive"></div>
    Comment

Restrictions
    We can restrict our directives to only be invoked by some of the methods.
The legal restrict values are:
    E - for Element name
    A - for Attribute
    C - for Class
    M - for Comment
    EA - by default the value is this,
        meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive


1. ng-init directive - initializes AngularJS application variables, this is not very common
                       Instead of this, we use controllers or modules
2. ng-app  directive - defines the application, define the root element of an application
                       This directive will auto-boostrap(automatically initialize) the application when a web page is loaded
3. ng-controller     - defines the controller
4. ng-repeat         - used on an array of objects
                       clones HTML elements once for each item in a collection

5. ng-model          - binds the value of HTML controls(input, select, textarea)
                       can provide type validation for application data
                       provide CSS classes for HTML elements
