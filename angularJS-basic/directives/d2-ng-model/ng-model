Two-Way Binding
The binding goes both ways.
If the user changes the value inside the input field, the AngularJS property will also change its value:

Data binding in AngularJS is the synchronization between the model and the view.
When data in the model changes, the view reflects the change, and when data in the view changes, the model is updated as well.
This happens immediately and automatically, which makes sure that the model and the view is updated at all times.


The ng-model directive can provide type validation for application data (number, e-mail, required)
